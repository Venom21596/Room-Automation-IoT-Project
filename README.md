# Room-Automation-IoT-Project
End Assessment Project

Aim

To develop a room automation system for remote monitoring and control using Cisco Packet Tracer, enabling automatic management of the fan and room lamp.

Problem Statement

In modern smart homes, energy efficiency and remote control are key requirements. Manual control of appliances like fans and lamps leads to inconvenience and power wastage. Therefore, a system is needed that allows automation and monitoring of these appliances remotely.

Scope of the Solution

Control and monitor room appliances (fan and lamp) through IoT network.

Simulate automation features such as automatic ON/OFF based on sensor input.

Remote monitoring and management via a simulated IoT server in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Demonstrates IoT concepts like device connectivity, sensors, and remote control.

Required Components to Develop the Solution

Software / IDE: Cisco Packet tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer (IoT simulation)

Hardware (simulated in Packet Tracer):

IoT Fan

IoT Lamp

IoT Gateway / Home Gateway

Remote access via IoT Server (Simulation)
