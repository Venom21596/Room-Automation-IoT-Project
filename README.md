# Room-Automation-IoT-Project
End Assessment Project

Aim:
To develop a room automation system for remote monitoring and control using Cisco Packet Tracer, enabling automatic management of the fan and room lamp.

Problem Statement:
In modern smart homes, energy efficiency and remote control are key requirements. Manual control of appliances like fans and lamps leads to inconvenience and power wastage. Therefore, a system is needed that allows automation and monitoring of these appliances remotely.


Scope of the Solution:
Control and monitor room appliances (fan and lamp) through IoT network.
Simulate automation features such as automatic ON/OFF based on sensor input.
Remote monitoring and management via a simulated IoT server in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Demonstrates IoT concepts like device connectivity, sensors, and remote control.


Required Components to Develop the Solution:

   Software / IDE: Cisco Packet tracer:
   Cisco Packet Tracer (IoT simulation)

   Hardware (simulated in Packet Tracer):
   IoT Fan
   IoT Lamp
   IoT Gateway / Home Gateway


Result:
The final simulated environment demonstrates the following key outcomes:
Successful Network Configuration: A wireless local area network was established using a Home Gateway, which successfully connected to all IoT devices (lamp, fan) and the end-user device (smartphone).
Remote Accessibility: The system allows for remote access to the IoT device controls through a web-based interface. The user can log in to the Home Gateway from a smartphone connected to the same network.
Real-Time Control: The lamp and fan can be controlled in real-time. Toggling the controls on the smartphone's web browser results in an immediate visual state change in the simulated devices (the lamp lights up, and the fan's blades spin).

In conclusion, the system functions exactly as intended and meets all the objectives outlined in the problem statement. It serves as a successful proof-of-concept for a simple, scalable smart home automation network, effectively demonstrating the principles of the Internet of Things (IoT).
